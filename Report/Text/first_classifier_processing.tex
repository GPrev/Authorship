The classifier used was a K-nearest neighbors classifier. It was developped in java from scratch.
Due to the disparity of the features considered, all value have been normalized on a [0;1] scale.
The results are not a bit lacking; we should have a success ration close to 100\% on the training set.

The poor results are due to the lack of recognisable features; in fact, some of them could be deduced from the others : The number of lines is the number of ".", "?" and "!" for example.
