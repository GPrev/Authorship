- Stemmed and tagged files will be stored in different files (stemming and tagging takes ~3s per file, too long to do each time):
- I have finished to stem and to tag all the files, I can push the folder of all the files in git ... but I think that we can save time in using this library : http://evllabs.com/jgaap/w/index.php/Main_Page that contains already all the the operations that we want to use, just need to define what the representation of documents(stemmed, tagged, frequency of words etc), the analysis methods, ... are and finally we need to analyse the results in doing some stats.

- Paragraphs : impossible to count because of inconsistent text formatting
- Classifier 2 : use of existing library ? (teacher will be asked for permission)
- Report : everyone writes the part about what he or she works on
