# Authorship Attribution
AcqDeCo Project on authorship attribution.

In this project, the aim is to build a classier able to eciently attribute a new text to his/her
author, relying on textual characteristics (words, stems, ngrams of words or characters, punctuation
maks, etc.). At least two dierent representations of the textual data have to be compared.
